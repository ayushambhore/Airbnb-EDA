Introduction:

Airbnb is an online platform that enables people to rent out their homes or apartments to travelers looking for a place to stay. It has become a popular alternative to traditional hotels and has transformed the travel and hospitality industry. In this project, I have conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Airbnb NYC 2019 data to gain insights into the Airbnb market in New York City.


Dataset Description:

The Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset contains information on Airbnb listings in NYC, including attributes such as the listing price, neighborhood, property type, number of bedrooms, availability, and reviews. It consists of 48,895 records and 16 columns.


Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Before conducting any analysis, I cleaned and prepared the data to ensure that it was ready for exploration. The cleaning and preparation process involved handling missing values, converting data types, and removing outliers and irrelevant columns. I also performed some feature engineering, such as creating new variables based on existing ones. For example, I created a new variable called "price range‚Äù by dividing the range of price in certain intervals in graph 7.


Data Visualization:

I used various data visualization techniques to explore the distributions and relationships between the variables in the dataset. I created histograms, bar plots, pie charts, scatter plots, and maps to visualize the data. For example, I created a histogram of the listing price distribution to see how prices are distributed across the different neighborhoods in NYC.


Key Findings:

Our EDA of the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset revealed several key findings:

Manhattan has the highest number of listings, followed by Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island. This indicates that Manhattan is the most popular borough for Airbnb listings in NYC.
The most common property types are entire homes/apartments, followed by private rooms and the least is shared room. This suggests that most Airbnb listings in NYC are for bigger properties .
The price range varies widely throughout the New York , the most common price range is 0 to 50 dollar followed by 50 to 100 dollar.
We can see that majority of people prefer booking hotel with availability 1 day. A hotel for day-use is a very convenient solution for frequent travelers and businesspeople. That's why so many airport hotels offer daystays. * * Travelers can spend their transit time at a day-use hotel or simply book a dayroom for a stay between flights - an ideal way to relax.
Top 10 expensive locations are Fort Wadsworth , woodrow , Tribeca , Sea Gate , riverdale, Princes Bay ,Battery Park City , Flatiron District , Randall Manor , NoHo in this order.
Top 10 cheapest locations are Bulls Head, Hunts Point, Tremont, Soundview, New drop, Bronxdale, New Dorp Beach, Grant City, Concord, Mount Eden in this order.


Conclusion:

Our EDA of the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset provides valuable insights into the Airbnb market in NYC and highlights some of the key factors that influence listing prices and availability. These findings can be useful for hosts, guests, and policymakers who are interested in understanding the dynamics of the sharing economy and its impact on local communities. Further analysis, such as regression modeling or time-series forecasting, can be conducted to build predictive models and make more accurate predictions about Airbnb prices and availability in NYC.
